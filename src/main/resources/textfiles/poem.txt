For Summer has o'er - brimm'd their clammy cells.
Until they think warm days will never cease,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
Close bosom - friend of the maturing sun;
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
